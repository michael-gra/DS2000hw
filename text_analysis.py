Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing
whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
portion of that field, as a final resting place for
those who here gave their lives that that nation might
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we
can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground.
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add
or detract. The world will little note, nor long
remember what we say here, but it can never forget what
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is
rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before usâ€”that from these honored dead we
take increased devotion to that cause for which they
gave the last full measure of devotion that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in
vain that this nation, under God, shall have a new
birth of freedom and that government of the people, by
the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
earth.
